# Search Algorithm Visualizer

This project is a visualizer for various search algorithms implemented using Pygame. It allows users to draw walls, set starting and ending points, and visualize the pathfinding process of different algorithms.

## Features

- Draw walls, starting points, and ending points on a grid.
- Visualize the following search algorithms:
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - A\* Search
  - Uniform Cost Search

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/pireu2/search-visualizer
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd search-visualizer
   ```

3. Install dependencies
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the visualizer:

   ```sh
   python game.py
   ```

2. Use the following controls to interact with the grid:
   - Press w to draw walls.
   - Press s to draw the starting point.
   - Press e to draw the ending point.
   - Press r to reset the grid.
   - Press 1 to run BFS.
   - Press 2 to run DFS.
   - Press 3 to run Dijkstra's Algorithm.
   - Press 4 to run A\* Search.
   - Press 5 to run Uniform Cost Search.
